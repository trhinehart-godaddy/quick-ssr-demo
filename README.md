# Quick Guide to SSR with React, Redux, and ReactRouter

This guide provides a quick overview of how to use Server Side Rendering (SSR) with React@18 and an older version of
Redux and ReactRouter.

## Building the Project

To prepare the project for production development or deployment, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the project files for both the server and client, and stores them in a `dist` directory.

## Running the Server

After building the project, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

Once the server is running, you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Local Development

For local development, you can build and run the server simultaneously with the following command:

```bash
npm run watch
```

This command starts the server and monitors the source files for any changes. You can access the server
at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
